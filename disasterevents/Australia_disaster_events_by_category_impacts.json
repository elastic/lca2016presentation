Early the following day, workers showering after the night shift complained of skin irritation and poor quality drinking water. There were also reports of nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting from drinking contaminated water. Energy Resources Australia (ERA) admitted there were at least 28 workers that either drank or showered in water that had 400 times the legal dose of uranium.  Initial testing by ERA indicated that the water had a mild acidic ph of 4.5 and an elevated uranium content of eight parts per million. In response to this incident, ERA decided to close down both the clean water and process water systems, send non-essential staff home and conduct an orderly shutdown of the mine and all processing facilities.  A report by the Department of Environment and Heritage concluded that the primary cause of the contamination of the potable water system at the Ranger mine was that an operator opened a valve connecting the water manifold at the Fine Ore Bin (FOB) Scrubber to a one inch hose.

The first and most severe occurred over 8-9 June. Heavy rain, strong winds and large ocean swells resulted in widespread damage to coastal regions of the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney Metropolitan areas. The Queen's birthday weekend east coast lows developed in a pre-existing trough of low pressure over the northern Tasman Sea. This trough was directing a humid north-east to south-east air stream across north-east New South Wales and there was a weak low analysed just off the coast near Coffs Harbour on 8 June. The low moved south along the New South Wales coast, before moving out into the Tasman Sea on 10 June 2007.  Thunderstorms caused record breaking flooding in Newcastle, with 164.6 mm of rain falling in 6 hours from 3 pm to 9 pm, causing many shops and businesses to flood and hundreds of cars to be stranded or swept away. This storm event is often associated with the grounding of the Pasha Bulker (a 40,000 tonne bulk carrier ship) which occurred on 8 June on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle and was not re-floated until 2 July. Approximately 6000 people were evacuated from Maitland (near Newcastle) when it was considered that a levee may have burst.  In the Hunter Valley it was reported as the worst flooding in 52 years. Major flooding in the Hunter River occurred from 8 to 13 June and in the Paterson and Williams River from the 8 to 9 June. Moderate flooding occurred in the Wyong, Colo and Nepean Rivers.  Ferry services were cancelled on Sydney Harbour due to the weather conditions. The Cremorne wharf collapsed and sank due to large ocean swells. Beaches were eroded at many Sydney locations, due to swells up to 14 metres high. High winds blew beach sand over 100 metres inland. Over 200,000 homes reportedly lost power in the Sydney - Newcastle area due to flooding and high winds. Many thousands of homes and businesses lost telephone services when telephone exchanges were flooded.  A natural disaster was declared in the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast areas. There were a total of nine fatalities associated with the storm. Nearly 20,000 calls for assistance were made to the State Emergency Service.

The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters. During 48 hours of torrential rain more than 1000 emergency service staff worked to save homes and shops in towns throughout Gippsland. Relief centres were set up at Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Sale, Lucknow and Loch Sport and housed up to 360 evacuees. Volunteers also provided medical aid and catering with other organisations such as the Lions Club.

The roof of the Liverpool Street store collapsed and the structural damage was such that the remaining four walls had to be demolished to avoid damage to neighbouring buildings. Significant damage occurred to the contents of surrounding stores.  The Tasmanian Fire Service assessed the damage to&nbsp;the store&nbsp;and the surrounding businesses to cost in the vicinity of $50 million.", "Motor Vehicle(s) destroyed": null, "Building(s) destroyed": "1", "Com Premises destroyed": null, "Building(s) damaged": null, "lat": "-42.88118362", "Business(es) destroyed": null, "Motor Vehicle(s) damaged": null, "Deaths": null, "resourceType": "Disaster Event", "Ind Premises destroyed": null, "author": "", "Bridge(s) damaged": null, "url": "http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=21", "Homeless": null, "_id": 21, "Injuries": null, "Water vessel(s) damaged": null}, {"startDate": "2006-12-01T00:00:00", "Livestock destroyed": null, "endDate": "2007-02-07T00:00:00", "Crop(s) destroyed": "", "Insured Cost": null, "documentType": "", "Business(es) damaged": null, "Bridge(s) destroyed": null, "Farm(s) destroyed": null, "Aircraft destroyed": null, "Farm(s) damaged": null, "Home(s) destroyed": "51", "Train(s) destroyed": null, "Water vessel(s) destroyed": null, "id": "22", "Evacuated": null, "Aircraft damaged": null, "resourceUrl": "", "title": "Bushfire - Great Divide Complex", "lon": "147.1452179", "Train(s) damaged": null, "regions": "Victoria", "subjects": "", "Com Premises damaged": null, "Government assistance": null, "Home(s) damaged": null, "description": "Victoria experienced a very adverse fire season during 2006 - 2007. Lightning ignited a number of fires on 1 December 2006 and some later merged to form what is known as the 'Great Divide Complex' fires in eastern Victoria. The area burnt mostly public land and was estimated to be in the vicinity of 1.2 and 1.3 million hectares by the end of the season. On 7 February 2007, The Great Divide fires were finally contained after 69 days. There were also a number of other fires (Tawonga Gap burned 33,500 hectares and Tatong burned 33,000). Despite the severity of the fire season, housing and private asset losses were remarkably low. In total, 51 dwellings of which 21 were classified as primary residences were destroyed and hundreds of stock and farm fencing were lost in the fires. One man died in a vehicle accident while assisting a property owner to prepare for fire impact.  Thousands of community volunteers and career emergency service personnel across state, regional and community levels worked in partnership to ensure the fires were eventually brought under control. A further component to the response was the support and assistance from New Zealand, United States, Canadian and interstate colleagues.  By 7 February, more than 1400 firefighters had been injured in the fire fighting effort (including bruises, cuts, blisters, burns, dehydration, broken limbs and spider bites). More than 400 St John Ambulance volunteers, including doctors, nurses and first aid officers provided medical assistance. On 16 December, 11 New Zealand firefighters were injured while fighting the fire in the Howqua Valley in north-east Victoria.  On 16 January 2007 power lines were cut which severely disrupted Melbourne electricity supplies. On the same day, a fire threatened to close Tullamarine Airport. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) worked with Melbourne Water to keep the fires out of the water catchments.  A significant number of people were evacuated during the fires. Relief centres were established to accommodate evacuees. Some mountain tourist complexes were evacuated due to fires including Mount Buller and Thredbo Village in New South Wales, the latter due to a fire that started from a lightning strike at Hermit Mountain and crossed the border.  Victoria experienced widespread effects from the fires. Numerous schools in the high country and some parts of Gippsland were forced to close due to the fire threat and outside play at school was banned in some instances due to smoke haze. The smoke haze reportedly caused some respiratory symptoms and aggravated conditions such as asthma. Haze also ffected traffic and delayed flights in and out of Melbourne airport. On 20 December, the Environment Protection Authority recorded its worst bushfire smoke since records began, with visibility reduced to two km in Melbourne's central business district.  During the fire season, the Country Fire Authority, Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria received operational assistance from other states and a significant international contingent:    ACT - 37 personnel  NSW - 1050 personnel  NT - 108 personnel  SA - 10 personnel  Qld - 14 personnel  WA - 20 personnel  Canada - 52 personnel  New Zealand - 115 personnel  USA - 114 personnel    The Victorian and Federal Government provided financial assistance to aid personal, physical and economic recovery from the fire disaster.

In addition to the two houses at Mt Eliza, 41 houses were destroyed and 45 damaged in the Dandenongs. Three people died (at Ferny Creek) and approximately 40 were injured throughout the State.

The 3801 locomotive, also bound for Sydney, had stopped on a rise from the Hawkesbury River and was building up steam to get up the grade (Cowan Bank) when the Sydney bound train emerged from the Boronia tunnel near Brooklyn and collided with the 3801.  The accident happened 5 km south of the Brooklyn Bridge, between the Hawkesbury River and the town of Cowan. A total of 93 people were injured and six people died. The front of the four-carriage Sydney train was derailed in the accident.  An interim ban was placed on the use of steam locomotives on the New South Wales railway system.  A Coronial inquiry found that a railway signal fault occurred due to sand being dumped on the rail by the driver of 3801 to provide traction when the train went into a violent wheel-spin as it approached the Boronia tunnel. A handbrake in one of the steam train's carriages may have been partially applied, the inquiry found, to cause the train to slow down. Just outside the tunnel, the driver opened the valve to full throttle and the steam train pulled to a complete stop and more sand was applied to the rails.  While the 3801 was attempting to climb the hill, the Sydney - Newcastle train was stopped at a red signal on the other side of the tunnel. The lights apparently fluctuated from red to green seemingly because of sand on the rails. When the lights stayed permanently on the green the urban train moved forward through the tunnel, when the crash with 3801 occurred. The force of the impact destroyed the last carriage of the historic train and demolished the front carriage of the Sydney train.  Those involved in the incident were cleared of blame, however, it was said that although the signals had tested satisfactorily, the sand applied to the line by 3801 may have caused them to malfunction on the day.", "Motor Vehicle(s) destroyed": null, "Building(s) destroyed": null, "Com Premises destroyed": null, "Building(s) damaged": null, "lat": "-33.54511642", "Business(es) destroyed": null, "Motor Vehicle(s) damaged": null, "Deaths": "6", "resourceType": "Disaster Event", "Ind Premises destroyed": null, "author": "", "Bridge(s) damaged": null, "url": "http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40", "Homeless": null, "_id": 40, "Injuries": "93", "Water vessel(s) damaged": null}, {"startDate": "1986-01-27T00:00:00", "Livestock destroyed": null, "endDate": "1986-02-05T00:00:00", "Crop(s) destroyed": "", "Insured Cost": "40000000", "documentType": "", "Business(es) damaged": null, "Bridge(s) destroyed": null, "Farm(s) destroyed": null, "Aircraft destroyed": null, "Farm(s) damaged": null, "Home(s) destroyed": null, "Train(s) destroyed": null, "Water vessel(s) destroyed": "12", "id": "41", "Evacuated": null, "Aircraft damaged": null, "resourceUrl": "", "title": "Cyclone Winifred", "lon": "146.1140442", "Train(s) damaged": null, "regions": "Queensland", "subjects": "", "Com Premises damaged": null, "Government assistance": null, "Home(s) damaged": null, "description": "Tropical Cyclone Winifred registered as a category three cyclone and recorded wind gusts up to 175 km per hour, near Cowley Beach south of Innisfail.

Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter.  The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents' ttempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 m, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away.  The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period.

The facility was estimated to have been storing up to 500,000 litres of chemicals and toxic solvents, largely those used in the motor vehicle and dry-cleaning industries. The combustion of stored toxic waste together with flammable material contributed to the creation of a dense toxic smoke plume.  The fire was one of the biggest hazardous materials fire in Australian history. More than 2,000,000 litres of water were applied to extinguish the fire and over 350 FESA personnel, including volunteers, responded to the emergency.  It took more than two days to extinguish the fire and 50 people were evacuated.  The fire destroyed the majority of chemicals stored on the site and also burnt bushland down to the Helena River. Initial clean-up costs were approximately $5.6 million.Toxic fumes were discharged into the atmosphere and residue from the fire landed in surrounding areas and covered buildings and vehicles in the vicinity that subsequently had to be decontaminated. Public health concerns were raised about a range of experiences of exposure to contaminants emanating from the fire.  Hundreds of thousands of litres of contaminated water had to be pumped from drains after the fire and all drains had to be thoroughly decontaminated.  A specialised drum shredding and waste collection machine was designed and constructed. Six months after the fire, the drums were processed and the waste encased in concrete, painted in impervious paint and disposed of in a class four land fill.  The fire also held economic impacts as the company received the majority of Perth's hazardous liquid wastes and the only other facility was shut down by the government in 2003. Consequently, waste had to be transported at least 800 km for disposal. Bellevue property values were affected and increased regulation of hazardous waste and chemical industries was introduced.  A Health Register was established under the guidance of a Steering Committee following a recommendation from the Bellevue Hazardous Waste Fire Parliamentary Inquiry. The First Report found that of the 218 people that elected to be part of the Bellevue Health Surveillance Register, 60 per cent reported at least one symptom that they thought was related to the fire but most symptoms did not last long. Typical symptoms included sore eyes, coughs, colds, chest complaints, dizziness, vomiting, nausea and headache.  Due to the hazardous nature of the site, a proper scene examination and the origin and cause of the fire could not be established. Furthermore, the fire destroyed most evidence and the immediate clean-up removed any other evidence there may have been.

Wide spread floods caused damage to plantations, crops and infrastructure, which resulted in several large damage estimates. This included $70 million to cane and banana industries compiled with $50 million to existing infrastructure.   The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2000 damage at $12 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $30 million.", "Motor Vehicle(s) destroyed": null, "Building(s) destroyed": null, "Com Premises destroyed": null, "Building(s) damaged": null, "lat": "-16.92339897", "Business(es) destroyed": null, "Motor Vehicle(s) damaged": null, "Deaths": null, "resourceType": "Disaster Event", "Ind Premises destroyed": null, "author": "", "Bridge(s) damaged": null, "url": "http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=127", "Homeless": null, "_id": 126, "Injuries": "10", "Water vessel(s) damaged": null}, {"startDate": "1971-12-24T00:00:00", "Livestock destroyed": null, "endDate": "1971-12-27T00:00:00", "Crop(s) destroyed": "", "Insured Cost": "25000000", "documentType": "", "Business(es) damaged": null, "Bridge(s) destroyed": null, "Farm(s) destroyed": null, "Aircraft destroyed": null, "Farm(s) damaged": null, "Home(s) destroyed": null, "Train(s) destroyed": null, "Water vessel(s) destroyed": null, "id": "128", "Evacuated": null, "Aircraft damaged": null, "resourceUrl": "", "title": "Cyclone Althea", "lon": "146.8206024", "Train(s) damaged": null, "regions": "Queensland", "subjects": "", "Com Premises damaged": null, "Government assistance": null, "Home(s) damaged": "1000", "description": "On 24 December 1971, Tropical Cyclone Althea swept across Townsville resulting in three deaths.

On 16 February itself, there was low humidity, heat wave conditions and strong to gale force winds. Temperatures varied between high thirties and mid forties over most of eastern South Australia and Victoria with relative humidity generally less than 15 per cent.  The Victorian bushfire season had started in November 1982. There were 854 bushfires reported at this time including, Ballan, Mount Macedon on 1 February, Cann River and Mount Donna Buang.  On early Ash Wednesday morning there were 104 fires already burning in Victoria most controlled or contained, it was only after 2.00 pm that the situation exploded.  The Victorian fires formed several complexes.  1. Western district near Warrnambool. This fire started from a defective private power line. The resulting fire front was kilometres wide and moving at frightening speed. A cool change came through at 5.00 pm and the wind changed to the south-west. The fire headed toward the town of Terang. The fire passed the town to its north and was brought under control the next day. In total nine people died, 50,000 hectares burnt, 157 houses destroyed and 19,300 livestock was lost.  Another person died near Branxholme from a smaller fire caused by power line fault.  2. East Trentham&nbsp;- Macedon fire complex. This fire began around 2.00 pm near East Trentham due to two powerlines touching and sparking. The fire moved to the Wombat State Forest and burnt much of Bullengarook. The fire stalled for a while but upon wind change to the south-west the fire picked up again and headed toward Woodend with a 7 m fire front at 8.30 pm. It reached Macedon where people and animals sheltered in the Hotel protected by volunteers. The rest of the town was annihilated. After reaching the top of Mount Macedon it was controlled in an area that was previously burnt on 1 February. Seven people died, 20,000 hectares burnt, 200 homes destroyed in Macedon, 150 on Mount Macedon, 50 in Bullengarook and 20 in Woodend.  3. Otways complex. The fire broke out approximately 3.00 pm at Deans Marsh and moved toward Lorne eventually onto the ridges above the town on and down to the sand dunes with many people taking refuge in the sea. The fire moved to Aireys Inlet where the fibro houses were hit by walls of flame and a gigantic firestorm. The fire moved at extraordinary speed and next hit was Anglesea, where houses were lost but the main part of town was saved. The fire burnt on through the night toward Jan Juc and Torquay and was eventually contained early morning near Bellbrae. Three people were killed and 578 houses and other buildings were lost.  4. Upper Beaconsfield - Cockatoo complex. This fire began in Belgrave Heights south of Mount Dandenong. Half an hour later 10 km away, a fire started in Cockatoo and remained static until later that night. The first fire moved 15 km toward Berwick and Pakenham and firefighters were just beginning to gain control when the wind change came through at 8.30 pm redirecting the fire towards Upper Beaconsfield. Firefighters were caught in terrible circumstances leading to deaths. The Cockatoo fire began to flare at 7.30 pm. The fire went right through the town of Cockatoo as fire trucks had been called away to other fires. There were reports of women and children being sheltered and saved at a local kindergarten. The kindergarden&nbsp;building was later&nbsp;recorded by Heritage Victoria as a building of significance to be protected.&nbsp;In total, 27 people died, 100 were injured and 535 houses and buildings destroyed.  5. Warburton complex. This fire erupted in the foothills of mountain ash forests. The fire began in Millgrove at 7.30 pm and quickly progressed to Warburton. Approximately 200 people took shelter at the local oval and a creek in underground tunnel. Thirty houses were destroyed.  In Victoria in summary, 47 people died, 150,000 hectares burnt, 1620 houses burnt and more than 1500 other buildings were destroyed and 32,400 livestock lost.  South Australia  Major fires were burning by noon on Ash Wednesday, particularly in the Adelaide Hills, Clare Valley 120 km north of Adelaide, and around Mount Gambier, the south-east of the state. By 3.00 pm the situation was extreme. The cold front then hit with winds at 90 to 100 km per hour and the intensity of the fires worsened again. By 9.00 pm rain began to fall and the fires in the Adelaide hills came under control. The fires near Mount Gambier took longer. In total 28 people died, including three CFS volunteer fire fighters, more than 1500 people injured, 383 homes and 200 other buildings destroyed and 160,000 hectares burnt.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1983 damage for Victoria at $138 million and South Australia at $38 million with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $1489 million for Victoria and $307 million for South Australia.  &nbsp;", "Motor Vehicle(s) destroyed": null, "Building(s) destroyed": null, "Com Premises destroyed": null, "Building(s) damaged": null, "lat": "-37.40233612", "Business(es) destroyed": null, "Motor Vehicle(s) damaged": null, "Deaths": "75", "resourceType": "Disaster Event", "Ind Premises destroyed": null, "author": "", "Bridge(s) damaged": null, "url": "http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=131", "Homeless": "9000", "_id": 130, "Injuries": "1500", "Water vessel(s) damaged": null}, {"startDate": "1940-04-07T00:00:00", "Livestock destroyed": null, "endDate": "1940-04-09T00:00:00", "Crop(s) destroyed": "", "Insured Cost": null, "documentType": "", "Business(es) damaged": null, "Bridge(s) destroyed": null, "Farm(s) destroyed": null, "Aircraft destroyed": null, "Farm(s) damaged": null, "Home(s) destroyed": null, "Train(s) destroyed": null, "Water vessel(s) destroyed": null, "id": "132", "Evacuated": null, "Aircraft damaged": null, "resourceUrl": "", "title": "Flood - Burdekin River", "lon": "146.9641113", "Train(s) damaged": null, "regions": "Queensland", "subjects": "", "Com Premises damaged": null, "Government assistance": null, "Home(s) damaged": null, "description": "A tropical cyclone that crossed the coast near Townsville brought heavy rain and caused widespread flooding to multiple areas along Queensland's central coast.

A major emergency response occurred with fleets of ambulance, helicopters, Sate Emergency Services, Fire brigade and Police attending the incident.  A New South Wales Coroners report found that the Sydney bound coach driver fell asleep at the wheel which resulted in the collision. The Coroner found the Sydney bound coach missed a bend on the highway and there was no indication that the driver had applied brakes or dimmed the headlights before the collision. Neither coach was speeding at the time of the crash, and no mechanical faults were found in either vehicle, the coroner said.  The coroner renewed calls for the creation of a dual-carriageway highway between Newcastle and the Queensland border, following an earlier 21 deaths in a coach/semi-trailer accident at Cowper, north of Grafton in October 1989 (see related event). The Coroner also recommended a review of coach seats, seat anchorages, seatbelts and better emergency exits for coaches, as rescuers were unable to enter the wreckage immediately because the exits were more than two metres above the ground.

Subsequent heavy rain affected the Gold Coast and Logan City, with heavy rain falling over Brisbane City, producing areas of flash flooding, particularly across southern suburbs but also in the east and north. Intense rainfall was observed across the district for duration of approximately 6 hours.  Gold Coast and Logan City: A person drowned during the early morning hours of 11 March, when the vehicle in which they were passenger was swept off a road near Logan. Many homes and businesses were damaged by flash flooding. Flooding at Beenleigh also led to four houses being inundated with sewage.  Brisbane City: A person was confirmed drowned, after being swept away by flood waters on the evening of 9 March, when vehicle in which they were passenger was washed off a road at Lawnton (in Brisbane's north). The damage inventory included hundreds of cars, many shops and offices, and up to 600 homes.  Stones Corner, a suburb in inner-eastern Brisbane, was one of the worst hit areas. Metre-deep flooding entered East's League's Club, forcing 50 patrons to be evacuated. About 30 cars were submerged in the club car park. Many houses throughout Brisbane's southern suburbs were also flooded. Over 100 homes were inundated in Wishart (southern suburb). Heavy rain downed powerlines at Annerley, Woolloongabba, Greenslopes and Holland Park. A block of flats at Greenslopes had the roof torn off. Cars that were stalled on flooded roads caused peak-hour traffic chaos. Many cars that had been left in flooded streets floated away. A car dealership in Salisbury reported damage to about 50 vehicles.  Three flights were diverted from Brisbane Airport to the Amberley RAAF Base after lights along the Brisbane runway went out (due to lightning). A house boat, moored on Norman Creek in eastern Brisbane, was damaged. The northern suburbs of McDowall, Windsor, Ferny Hills, Arana Hills and Everton Hills also recorded severe water damage. In the northern suburb of Aspley,six new cars were swept from the yard of a car dealership and into Cabbage Tree Creek and another 80 new vehicles were damaged. Flash flooding caused problems in Everton Hills near Kedron Brook.  Sunshine Coast: A person was rescued from a vehicle that was washed into a waterway. Shops in the main street of Beerwah were flooded, trees came down on powerlines and cars were swept away. Numerous traffic accidents were reported. Flash flooding was also reported near Sunrise Beach, and at Noosaville, Nambour, Eumundi and Hunchy. Powerlines were brought down at Nambour.

The Lake Illawarra sank after running into and demolishing part of the Tasman Bridge that crossed the Derwent River at Hobart, 5 January 1975. The vessel was en route from Port Pirie in South Australia with a cargo of zinc. When approaching the bridge, the captain reduced speed, but was finding it difficult to align the ship to the central navigation span of the bridge. Despite several attempts to change the course, the ship was difficult to manage in part due to the lack of speed. The master finally called out full speed astern in a last attempt to change the course of the ship when the ship veered into the pile capping of Pier 18 and then Pier 19 bringing the three unsupported spans of the bridge crashing into vessels' hull. The ship sank within minutes in deep water.  Seven crew members on the ship died and four cars ran over the gap into the Derwent River, five occupants died while others managed to escape from the two vehicles which teetered on the edge of the gap. The collapse effectively divided Hobart in two. Police and emergency services were called into action and within an hour a ferry was traversing the river. The next day there were three private ferries and one government run ferry in operation. Eastern shore residents were severely hindered by the collapse as most hospitals, schools, businesses and government offices were located on the west shore.  A temporary bridge (the Bailey bridge) with one lane in each direction was built and opened to traffic on 16 December 1975.

The first fires to break out were in the Cessnock, Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury and Penrith areas. The fires lasted for approximately 23 days and required over 20,000 regular and volunteer firefighters as well as 85 aircraft. The worst fires were in the Huskisson / Sussex Inlet area near Jervis Bay in the Illawarra and the Deua National Park west of Moruya.  The weather across all affected areas during this time included temperatures of up to 45&ordm; C, winds in excess of 90 km per hour, relative humidity as low as 6 per cent and Fire Danger Ratings of up to 100.  Twenty-six bushfire emergency declarations were made, incorporating the 48 local government areas of Blue Mountains / Lithgow / Rylstone, Cessnock / Wyong, Hawkesbury, Kempsey, Mudgee, Oberon / Mulwarree, Richmond Valley / Maclean, Shoalhaven / Tallaganda, Gosford, Penrith / Fairfield / Blacktown / Liverpool, Singleton / Muswellbrook, Sutherland, Wollondilly / Campbelltown / Wingecarribee, Wollongong / Kiama / Shellharbour, Baulkham Hills / Hornsby / Ku-ring-gai / Ryde / Lane Cove, Grafton / Pristine Waters / Maclean / Copmanhurst, Eurobodalla, Warringah / Pittwater, Narrabri, Kempsey, Cabonne, Coffs Harbour, Richmond Valley, Greater Taree, Kempsey and Walcha.  The fires burnt approximately 753,314 hectares, destroyed 109 houses and damaged a further 40. They also destroyed 433 outbuildings, 222 vehicles, and 7043 stock and 33 commercial and industrial buildings.

This was the first and only escape of its kind on Australian soil.  A Military Court of Inquiry investigated the incident, and a summary of its findings was read to the House of Representatives by Prime Minister John Curtin on 8 September 1944. The inquiry drew several conclusions from the incident. Firstly, conditions at the camp were fully in accordance with the International Convention. Secondly, no complaints regarding treatment had been made by or on behalf of the Japanese prior to the incident. Thirdly, the actions of the Australian garrison in resisting the attack averted greater loss of life, and that firing ceased as soon as control was assured. Finally, many of the dead had died by suicide or by the hand of other prisoners, and that many of the wounded had suffered self-inflicted wounds.  The incident lasted 10 days and resulted in the death of 231 Japanese prisoners with a further 108 wounded. Four Australian soldiers were killed in the event with two being posthumously awarded the George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism.

Heavy rainfalls intensified over the following days, particularly in the Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie regions.  River systems in the region were at capacity and tidal systems in correlation with the king tides caused further complexities with rising flood water. The following river systems were affected; Richmond, Clarence, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay, Hastings, Manning, Paterson and Hunter. The rising water exceeded levees in Kempsey and the traffic bridge at Kempsey peaked at a height of 6.9 m. Other significant damage included; 94 businesses with an estimated direct cost of $28,000 per business, streets closed to traffic and 100 people evacuated from the Mirriwina Gardens settlement (50 km north-west of Kempsey).  The Clarence River also threatened to exceed levees causing precautionary evacuations of more than 1000 people, including 80 patients from the Grafton Hospital. The Grafton levee bank was able to hold the water within the river system, which finally peaked at 7.75 m.  The effects of the flooding were wide spread and inundations and dislocation of services affected up to 28 local government areas.The Pacific Highway, the main route in many of these regions, was cut for several days. Rail services were also reported as suspended. Furthermore, reports of damage included; Yamba becoming isolated, Gladstone and Smithtown where sewerage infrastructure failed and Ulmarra (population of 470) was ordered to evacuate. Bellingen, Thora, Kaland and Darkwood, South West Rocks, Hat Head, and Crescent Head were isolated and required food and medical drops by helicopter.  The response units included; State Emergency Services (SES) a contingent of 1300 volunteers from 83 units, Rural Fire Service (RFS), New South Wales Fire Brigade (NSWFB), Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA), Police, and Council workers. Additional supporting equipment used in the response included; ten heavy tankers, 12 flood boats, and 11 helicopters.  Estimated costs to roads and bridges was $3 million, water and sewerage infrastructure $500,000.

They first emerged at serious levels in 1937, with New South Wales, Victoria, much of Queensland and parts of Western Australia affected. Isolated parts of New South Wales, notably in the central west, suffered record low rainfall. In 1938 there was further deterioration in New South Wales and Victoria and it also spread to eastern South Australia and the south-west grain growing region of Western Australia where wheat yields plummeted to their lowest level since 1914.  In Victoria, a very dry six month period provided the right conditions for the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in January 1939. Heavy rain fell in late February 1939 over Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, and for the remainder of the year abundant rain fell over eastern and central Australia. However dry weather occurred again and 1940 was one of the driest years of the century over most of the southern parts of the country. Dams were empty in New South Wales and Brisbane had water restrictions. January 1941 saw rain again, but by the second half of that year was again very dry. The following 12 months were good for general rain, but again dry conditions returned in 1943, and were worse again in 1944 when a failure of the wheat crop occurred in several places. The drought continued into 1945 and large rivers such as the Hunter were virtually dry. By April 1945 most Victorian water storage facilities were empty, the Murray river ceased flow at Echuca and Adelaide faced water shortages.  Financial losses were severe during this drought. The number of sheep that died in 1945 alone was 10 million in New South Wales. In 1946 Queensland financial losses caused by the drought were estimated at &pound;25 million. Approximately four million sheep died in South Australia over 1944 and 1945.  The drought finally ended in the southern states during the winter of 1945 but continued into 1946 in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland.

Rain began in northern Tasmania on the night of 3 April and reached its peak the following day, finally clearing on 6 April. The highest rainfall totals were recorded in the high country of the north-east and there was a secondary area of very heavy rain south of the Burnie/Ulverstone area. In both cases up to 500 mm of rain fell in three days.  During the floods 22 people drowned. Fourteen people died when the Briseis Dam at Derby burst its banks and a torrent of water travelled three miles through the narrow gorge of the Cascade River to the township of Derby carrying with it trees and tonnes of debris which inflicted serious damage.  In the town of Avoca the river was measured at approximately 17 m above the average summer level. When the waters finally receded, the railway station had disappeared, railway tracks were undermined and twisted, bridges were destroyed and debris blocked the railway line. Many road bridges in the north and north-east were lost.  On the north coast most rivers were severely flooded. At Gawler, near Ulverstone, a truck crashed through a bridge into a flooded river, drowning eight people.  In the Tamar Valley flood waters caused the river to rise to record levels. Flood waters passed through Cataract Gorge and combined with floodwaters from the North Esk, inundated more than 1,000 houses in the low-lying parts of Launceston. Some 3,500 people were evacuated. The power station at Duck Reach was washed away.  In southern Tasmania the rain was substantial and caused rivers to flow across roads and many livestock were lost.

Lightning ignited 87 fires in the North-East and East Gippsland regions. Eight of these fires were unable to be contained; they joined together to form the largest fire in Victoria since the Black Friday fires in 1939. More than 40 fires were also started in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory.  The majority of the area burnt in Victoria was public land, 1.19 million hectares of parks and forests, including 60 per cent of the Alpine National Park and 81 per cent of the Mt Buffalo National Park. Fire fighting efforts were made difficult in hard to access, remote forest terrain. Approximately 90,000 hectares of private land was burnt. The fires burnt nearly 800,000 hectares in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory, bringing the total of land affected throughout the Australian Alps to approximately 2 million hectares. The immediate effects of the fires included reduced water quality and quantity, loss of vegetation and habitats, destruction of commercial timber infrastructure, damage to recreation and tourism infrastructure assets and destruction of cultural sites and farms adjacent to public land.  A Ministerial Taskforce, appointed by the Victorian Premier, announced a funding package of $70.6 million for recovery works on public land associated with natural and cultural assets and support for agricultural private landowners affected by the fires. This was the biggest bushfire recovery effort ever undertaken in Victoria at the time. The Bushfire Recovery Program for the environment and agriculture focused on four areas:  1. Asset repair or replacement in parks, forests and alpine resorts ($24.9 million)  2. Protection and restoration of water catchments and water supply ($23.9 million)  3. Restoration of ecological and cultural heritage values ($13.2 million)  4. Providing practical assistance for affected farm enterprises ($8.6 million) Assets lost or damaged included; 41 houses, 213 other structures, three bridges and 10,000 livestock.

Some examples are:    Kellyville, hail 5 cm,  Blacktown, hail 4 cm,  Kings Langley, hail 3 cm,  Quakers Hill, hail 3 cm,  Greystanes, heavy rain and hail 4 cm,  Potts Hill, hail 2-3 cm,  Castle Hill, hail 4-5 cm,  Greenacre, hail 4-5 cm,  St Ives, heavy rain and hail 2 cm,  Wahroona, heavy rain and hail 3 cm,  Gosford, hail 4 cm and Terrigal hail 4-5 cm.    Flash flooding was seen in Bexley (metropolitan Sydney) and in North Ryde. A thunderstorm and possible tornado caused severe local wind damage, bringing down trees and power lines, resulting in power outages to thousands of homes.  The strongest wind gusts during the storm were felt at Bathurst with 93 km per hour, Scone 93 km per hour, Kurnell 94 km per hour and Newcastle 91 km per hour.  The unseasonal cold weather brought snow to some areas of New South Wales where approximately 10-15 cm snow fell in the Snowy Mountains and temperatures reached as low as minus 5&deg;C. On the Brindabella Ranges near Canberra and on the Southern Tablelands, several centimetres of snow settled on the ground. Record low maximum and minimum temperatures occurred over this period, especially in the southern areas of the state.  Victoria  Substantial rainfall was reported in many areas of Victoria with 24 hour rainfall totals exceeding 150 mm in many places. Rainfall in the Melbourne metropolitan area exceeded 100 mm with an all time 24 hour record for Melbourne set at 120.2 mm (the previous record was 108 mm).  The highest wind gusts were recorded at Wilson's Promontory with gusts of up to 148 km per hour. In the Melbourne area wind gusts to 104 km per hour were recorded at Fawkner and Beacon.  Extensive damage to buildings was reported and over 7000 requests for assistance were received by the SES and other emergency services over the following days.  Tasmania  During this storm, Tasmania experienced widespread damage particularly from wind gusts. The strong south easterly winds caused damage from Devonport to Bridport, Scottsdale and Winnaleah in the north-east, Binalong Bay on the East Coast, and to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Port Sorell (near Devonport) reported many homes to be badly damaged in part due to falling trees.  Approximately 25 yachts in the Tamar River broke their moorings, with 14 reportedly destroyed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars damage.  The Bass Strait ferry Spirit of Tasmania l was forced to return to Melbourne after sustaining damage in seas estimated at 20 m. The Spirit of Tasmania II was delayed on its voyage from Devonport to Melbourne, while the Spirit of Tasmania III broke its moorings in Devonport and was also slightly damaged.  Fruit crops sustained up to 50 per cent loss; particularly apple and pear growers. Damage was also sustained to poppy and grain crops.  Strong winds battered Tasmania during this storm, some examples are; Mount Wellington 104 km per hour, Mount Read 93 km per hour, Eddystone Point 117 km per hour, Flinders Island Airport 100 km per hour, Launceston Airport 94 km per hour and Cape Bruny on Bruny Island 91 km per hour.  On 3 February substantial rainfall accompanied the storm and flooding occurred in several areas on the east coast, some suburbs of Hobart and in the south-east. The Browns River at Kingston broke its banks causing local flooding with several minor landslides also reported in the area.  South Australia  Gale force winds of up to 67 km per hour occurred at several locations in South Australia during this storm event. These occurred in Marree and briefly at Hindmarsh Island.

The epicentre was 30 km under the seabed and approximately 250 km south to south-west of Banda Aceh.&nbsp;In the nine hours following the enormous earthquake, 14 aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.7 and 7.3 occurred along the arc from Sumatra towards Nicobar and the Andaman Islands. Over a hundred aftershocks were recorded. The quakes triggered powerful tsunamis towering 10 m in height that moved through the Indian Ocean region at over 500 km per hour. The tsunami waves caused widespread death and injuries, displaced thousands, destroyed towns, homes, livelihoods, infrastructure, and wrecked coastal areas. The worst affected countries were India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Seychelles, Thailand and Somalia. Bangladesh, Kenya and Australia also absorbed some of the effect of the tsunami. Financial losses in the Maldives represented approximately 45 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), while Indonesia suffered $4.5 billion in economic losses, representing the entire GDP of the Aceh Province. The overall financial impact on the Indonesian economy lowered the projected growth by approximately 0.2 per cent in 2005. Geoscience Australia stated the earthquake was the result of plate collision at the boundary of two tectonic plates, creating a large fault or offset on the ocean floor. The displacement of the ocean floor which generated the sea wave or tsunami, which spread from the epicentre across the Indian Ocean, was the largest recorded in 40 years.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent estimated the loss of life:    Dead 273,636 (220,153 in Indonesia alone)  Missing 7,253 (estimated)  Displaced 1,590,707 (estimated)  Homeless 507,496 (estimated)    Twenty six Australians lost their lives.

In total four people died and six people were injured as a result of these fires.  Considerable losses and damage occurred to property and infrastructure:    Houses destroyed: 57 (19 of these principle residences)  Buildings: 359 farm buildings lost, including 39 woolsheds and 22 hay sheds  Stock losses: 64,265 (63,243 sheep, 557 cattle and 464 other stock) and over 2,500 commercial beehives  Area burnt: 160,000 hectares (60 percent public land, 40 per cent private&nbsp;land - Approximately 98,000 hectares of national parks and conservation areas and 6,000 hectares of State forest were burnt)  Fencing: 364 km of crown land boundary fencing and 2281 km of other boundary or internal fencing    &nbsp;  The firefighting effort included more than 5000 volunteers, paid personnel and a significant assistance from interstate. Also on the ground were government, volunteer, business and community organisations who were involved in fire suppression activities and facilitating recovery efforts.

Community meetings were undertaken, both pre-fire and during the fire events, which assisted in keeping the community informed.  The immediate effects of the fires were displacement of residents and tourists, closure of schools and loss of power supply to many properties. Longer term impacts include reduction in tourism trade; at least 112 staff were laid off as a result of the fires. The Wimmera Development Corporation estimated that tourism downturn resulting from the bushfire devastation will cost the Grampians regional economy up to $100 million.  The damage to environment and water catchments was significant. The Grampians and Gippsland fires had the greatest impact on water quality. Water authorities commenced both short-term and long-term risk management activities.  The Grampians fires also affected over 240 km of roads across the local and state road network. The most significant damage to the road network occurred on the forest road system, including 1200 km of forestry roads affected in the Grampian's National Park.  The Victorian State Government provided financial assistance to people affected by the fires and to assist with restoration of infrastructure and the environment.

The winds at all levels through the atmosphere were very strong. A thunderstorm is classified as severe if it produces wind gusts of 90 km per hour of more. On this day gusts were much higher with reports of 135 km per hour to 160 km per hour.

Maximum wind gusts in Victoria were recorded at Mt Gellibrand at 131 km per hour, Dunns Hill in the Dandenongs at 115 km per hour and Melbourne Airport 107 km per hour.  Areas of raised dust were reported from the western half of the state, with visibility down to 200 m in some places.  The heaviest rainfall totals were from Falls Creek (Rocky Valley Dam) with 50 mm and Wilsons Promontory with 26 mm. The storm sent vegetation and debris flying, caused major disruption to Melbourne traffic and public transport systems and&nbsp;extensive damage to the electricity distribution network. Lanes were closed on the Westgate bridge where wind gusts were close to 120 km per hour, many traffic lights were out and conditions on the roads were chaotic. Several boats were washed ashore at Mornington, where large waves were observed.  There were reports that two people died as a result of this storm in Victoria.  More than 9,500 requests for assistance were received by emergency service agencies across the State between 2-7 April 2008 as a result of this event.  The Department of Human Services (DHS) coordinated Red Cross and local government to support the community with recovery, distributing 864 personal hardship grants totalling $240,115.

On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February.  In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends.  Flights out of the region were fully booked. The entire hospital population, more than 300 patients, were evacuated to other regional hospitals and Brisbane by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other methods.&nbsp; This was an unprecedented evacuation effort.  The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone&rsquo;s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars were found metres away from where they were left and boats were piled on top of each other in some regions.  Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville.  The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million hit to agriculture, particularly affecting banana and sugarcane crops.  The Federal Government processed over $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink.

A nuclear emergency was declared following explosions at various nuclear plants in the Fukushima area. Abnormally high levels of radioactive substances were later detected in seawater 100 m from the plant.  Due to radiation concerns, Japan halted some food shipments, which included the suspension of milk and certain vegetables from regions around the plant after abnormal radiation levels were found in the products.  There were 1964 registered Australians in Japan at the time of the earthquake, with 229 Australians registered in the affected areas.  The Australian Government assisted in recovery by providing $10 million to Red Cross Japan and also the Pacific Disaster Appeal.

Flood warnings were issued for the Macleay, Severn, Macintyre, Gwydir, Mehi, Namoi and Peel Rivers.New South Wales State Emergency Service volunteers prepared Wee Waa with food and emergency supplies, with predictions that the swollen Namoi River would isolate the town for some days. The rising waters made the roads in Wee Waa inaccessible to all but four-wheel drive vehicles. Water levels exceeded 6 m around 9:00 am on 27 November, before reaching 7 m on 29 November with major flooding.  Approximately 300 properties were isolated in Moree, and the town was cut in two after rising waters forced the closure of the local bridge.More properties were cut off in Gunnedah and the village of Garah, as waters in the Namoi, Gwydir, Peel and Mehi Rivers continued to rise. One person drowned after being pulled into a storm water drain in Bingara, near Inverell.  As the flood waters abated and moved downstream, the Department of Primary Industries were able to assess the flood damage. Hundreds of livestock, mainly sheep, died with most of the losses occurring between Garah and Weemelah. Fodder drops will continue to provide quality feed.  It has been estimated that approximately $52 million in flood damage has occurred to the cotton industry in the Gwydir Valley. The local growers' association says initial estimates are based on around 18,000 hectares; up to 30 per cent of the dryland crop and five per cent of irrigated crop being damaged. It warns these figures could worsen as the floodwaters move downstream inundating more cotton and upstream crops begin to emerge.

During 23-24 December, the tropical low began intensifying and at 3.30 am on Christmas Day the tropical low was named Tropical Cyclone Grant, approximately 60 km north of the Cobourg Peninsula.  Tropical Cyclone Grant intensified to a category 2 tropical cyclone at 3.30 pm and made landfall on the Cobourg Peninsula at 9 pm.  Tropical Cyclone Grant weakened rapidly once over land and was downgraded to below tropical cyclone intensity at 12.30 pm on 26 December, approximately 30 km north-west of Jabiru.  The Cyclone reached a maximum sustained wind speed of 100 km per hour, a maximum wind gust of 140 km per hour and a lowest central pressure of 978 hPa. Grant caused torrential rainfall over parts of the Cobourg Peninsula and the adjacent north coast of the Arnhem district.  Many trees were brought down in the community of Minjilang on the Cobourg Peninsula and the surrounding outstations and power supply was interrupted. Coastal erosion and minor flooding of low lying coastal areas was reported between the Cobourg Peninsula and Nhulunbuy due to spring tides, larger than usual swell and strong onshore monsoonal winds.  Overnight on 26 December and during the early morning of 27 December heavy rainfall occurred over the Edith, Cullen and Fergusson River Catchments, including 385 mm at Edith River Falls in the 24 hours to 9 am on 27 December, resulting in flash flooding along those rivers.  A rapid river rise damaged the Edith River railway bridge, causing a 20 wagon freight train to derail while crossing over it. The train was carrying 1500 tonnes of copper concentrate from OZ Minerals' Prominent Hill copper mine in South Australia when it derailed and up to 1200 tonnes of the substance spilled into the Edith River.  The copper concentrate from Oz Minerals' mine contains less than 0.008 per cent of uranium, which equates to 96 kg in 1200 tonnes of copper concentrate. Northern Territory Environment Department Chief Executive Jim Grant said copper concentrate is an&nbsp;environmental hazard and a threat to aquatic life, but that although it contains arsenic and silica it is not rated as highly toxic.  The two drivers of the crash were airlifted to Katherine for treatment of minor injuries and the 200 passengers on board were temporarily stranded.  Significant damage was also made to the Stuart Highway rendering it impassable for two to three days.

The main fire that started near Forcett caused significant damage to local townships, particularly Dunalley, east of Hobart, where more than half of the town&rsquo;s buildings and a primary school were destroyed. Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula's main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4&nbsp;to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.&nbsp; Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000&nbsp;to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire. The fire burnt for up to two weeks and was handed back to regional firefighters when conditions eventually improved. The other significant fire front was at Bicheno and Coles Bay where up to 15 properties were lost.  These fires were described as the worst in almost half a century. On 14 January a Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established and the state moved to recovery mode. The taskforce estimated that rebuilding communities could take up to two years, with contractors expected to start clearing damaged properties by the end of January.

On 2 January Mount Gambier reached a maximum of 41.7 &ordm; C and Renmark hit 42.3 &ordm; C. These temperatures prompted a South Australian power company to cut electricity supplies to approximately 3300 properties on the Fleurieu Peninsula on 2 January.  On 2 January Victoria recorded temperatures in the forties, with Melbourne reaching 40 &ordm; C and Dartmoor in the south-west recording the state&rsquo;s maximum of 43 &ordm; C.

It departed from Circular Quay, Sydney harbour for Watsons Bay at 4.15 pm on 3 November 1927 with an estimated 120 passengers on board.  At approximately 4.45 pm the Greycliffe veered to port, not realising that the 140 m, 7700 ton luxury passenger liner and mail ship RMS Tahiti was 100 m behind it. The Tahiti was travelling at a speed of 12 knots, and with such a small distance between the two vessels it was too late for the Tahiti to change direction or stop.  The Tahiti collided with the Greycliffe, rolling it over and cleaving it in two. The superstructure collapsed and many were killed by the hull and propellers as they ploughed through the ferry.  The Greycliffe's boiler imploded on contact with the cold water and the ship began to sink. Many went down with it. The collision caused the deaths of 40 people, including six children returning home from school.  On 8 January 1928 the Court of Marine Inquiry found the captain on the Tahiti responsible for the collision due to failure to observe harbour regulations and travelling approximately four knots over the speed limit. He was suspended from service.  The Coronial Inquiry, conducted concurrently with the Court of marine Inquiry, however found both captains negligent but not criminally so.  The Admiralty Court found that the major initiator of the incident was the turn of the Greycliffe without warning, observation or care. The court found that both parties were negligent but the Greycliffe held three fifths of the negligence as its turn was greater than reasonable or necessary.  On March 1990 an appeal in the Full Court upheld the decision of the Admiralty Court, however giving more negligence to the Captain of the Greycliffe with two thirds responsibility.

This generated patchy rain areas and isolated thunderstorms and heavy rain over the north of the state.  Minor to major flood warnings were issued for communities on the Mid North, Coffs Harbour and North Coast of New South Wales. There were reports of 300 mm falling in the space of three days in areas of the Bellinger River Valley and the Orara River catchment.  More than 2000 people were isolated by the rising floodwaters, with a number of road closures such as at the Pacific Highway and a caravan park in a low lying area evacuated.  From the 24 - 25 January New South Wales received almost 340 mm of rain. Overnight on the 24 January, the Tweed Valley saw heavy falls with 86 mm of rain at Couchy Creek, 100 mm at Numinbah and 100 mm at Bald Mountain.  Residents were isolated in the towns of Darkwood, near Coffs Harbour, the Thora and Kalang Valleys, and in Bellingen, on the Mid North Coast, where the flooded Bellinger River cut the town in two. More than a dozen homes and businesses in Bellingen were inundated. The Bellinger River at the Bellingen Bridge peaked at around 7 m, short of the 8.2 m that constitutes major flooding.  A landslide and waterfalls blocked the Waterfall Way between Dorrigo and Bellingen. Bellingen received 180 mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9 am on 27 January.  During this time the State Emergency Services received more than 1000 calls for assistance and over 50 flood rescues occurred.  By the beginning of February more than 16,500 people across the state were isolated, with the worst areas being Gunnedah and Wee Waa. Twenty-seven aircraft worked to supply those areas isolated.  On 5 February the Namoi River peaked at over 8 m in Gunnedah and the Mehi River near Moree reached more than 10.6 m, similar to the height reached in 1976 floods. Approximately 300 homes in Moree were inundated, and 1600 people were evacuated.  The concern became from floodwaters from Queensland moving downstream to northern areas of New South Wales such as Mungindi, Walgett, Bourke, Collarenebri and Brewarrina.  On 9 February, heavy rains caused flash flooding across western Sydney and the Illawarra, with the SES receiving approximately 450 calls for assistance.  On 20 February a similar event occurred with flash flooding across Sydney and the Illawarra prompting more than 300 requests for assistance to the SES. Terry Hills recorded 61 mm in an hour and Peakhurst recorded 26 mm in just ten minutes. Other suburbs affected included Banksia, Rockdale, Padstow Heights, Sylvania, Five Dock and Rosebery.  Up to 8000 people remained isolated for weeks in the north-west, receiving approximately 50 ton of daily deliveries such as medication, mail and food.  Heavy rains from the end of February to the beginning of March saw more than 75 per cent of New South Wales under water or threatened by floodwaters. Twenty-four hour rainfall totals to 9 am on 1 March reached up to 123 mm in Coolamon, 84 mm in Cootamundra, 83 mm in Broken Hill and widespread falls between 30 - 80 mm in the Illawarra district. Over 1700 people from the four towns of Bega, Eastgrove in Goulburn, Cooma and south-west Cowra were evacuated on 1-2 March.  Sydney's Warragamba Dam spilt at approx 6.53 pm on 2 March for the first time since 1998, causing authorities to cut power to 160 homes. The spillage prompted the evacuation of 1900 people from the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley area.The town of Pooncarie in western New South Wales received approximately 174 mm of rain and Ivanhoe 154 mm for the 48 hours to 9 am on Thursday, breaking two-day rainfall records.  In Towamba approximately 367 people were isolated following the closure of the Princes Highway.&nbsp;The SES responded to more than 740 requests for help as the large, slow-moving trough set in.&nbsp; Approximately 4600 people across the state were subject to evacuation orders and 2500 people were isolated, mostly on rural properties.  Approximately 9000 people were evacuated from Wagga Wagga and a state of emergency was declared as the town's flood levee was tested by a peak of 10.6 m on 6 March, risking inundation of more than 3000 properties.  Evacuations continued throughout the first week of March with approximately 236 people door knocked in the Lachlan River area, 600 people ordered to evacuate in Griffith, and flood evacuation orders issued for Forbes, Flowerdale, Urana, Barellan, Yenda, North Wagga, Gillenbah and parts of Gumly Gumly. The town of Forbes was cut in three by floodwaters, inundating dozens of businesses and homes in the CBD.More than 400,000 sandbags were distributed across New South Wales to protect communities from floodwaters.

Approximately 30 towns across the state's north-east were inundated, leaving 1000 properties isolated.&nbsp;Almost 2000 homes were flooded and more than 17,000 people requested emergency assistance.  On 12 March the Insurance Council of Australia stated that insurers had already received claims totalling more than $64 million from flood-affected homeowners in Victoria and New South Wales. Insurers received 8,200 claims across the declared catastrophe zone.&nbsp;On 31 January one person drowned when they attempted to drive through floodwaters 1.6 m deep.  On 4 March one person died and two others were admitted to hospital with hypothermia and severe bruising after their four wheel drive was caught in a swollen causeway near Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands.  On 9 March one person was found dead in floodwaters north of Bourke, and their vehicle partially submerged in a causeway.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $17,256,000 allocated to 14,834 claimants&nbsp; affected in the northern part of the state and&nbsp;$29,991,000 was allocated&nbsp;to pay over 28,860 claimants affected by flood in the southern New South Wales region.  &nbsp;  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2012 damage at $108.2 million which incorporated figures for both New South Wales and Victoria.

The State Emergency Service (SES) received approximately 500 requests for assistance between midnight and 4 pm across south-east Queensland. The SES efforts focused on the north side of Brisbane, in Boondall, Zillmere, Herston and Aspley. Most requests for assistance were for minor damage to properties and general and storm damage.&nbsp;On 24 January, evacuation centres were opened at Narangba and Deception Bay, north of Brisbane. Twelve homes were evacuated as a precaution at Burpengary, north of Brisbane, and another dozen homes were flooded further north on the Sunshine Coast. Power was cut to approximately 9500 homes and businesses across the south-east. Overnight Upper Springbrook recorded some of the heaviest rain falls, with 193 mm in the 12 hours to 6 am. Lower Springbrook recorded 173 mm, Upper Tallebudgera 142 mm and 127 mm at Mt Tamborine. Brisbane city and suburbs had between 80 and 120 mm of rain and Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast recorded 271 mm in just ten hours.  Thirteen dams across south-east Queensland began spilling water to cope with the deluge, which included 220 mm falls over 30 hours in some parts.  Council run Australia Day events planned for the Moreton Bay Region and for the Gold Coast's Evandale Parklands were forced to cancel due to the heavy rain.  The State Emergency Services received more than 650 calls for assistance on the morning of 27 January.   On 3 February a state of emergency was declared in Mitchell and approximately a quarter of the population was evacuated.. The Queensland Government requested assistance from the Australian Defence Force to provide aerial support and aid evacuations. The Maranoa River reached 9.85 m, breaking its 1956 record peak of 9.26 m. Almost half the population took refuge in a sports complex and when the flood threatened to isolate the complex helicopters were sent in to air-lift people to safety.  By 4 February the Warrego River in Charleville reached 7.7 m and over 280 homes were inundated when floodwaters in Roma peaked at 8.35 m. Approximately 50 per cent of homes experienced some form of inundation. More than 700 homes or businesses in the region needed assistance, and more than 440 were damaged with approximately 288 properties affected in Mitchell and 290 affected in Roma. One hundred and twenty Australian Defence Force soldiers assisted with the clean up in these regions.  On 5 February mandatory evacuations were ordered for St George after it was predicted the Balonne River would peak at up to 15 m. With more than 2600 people from a population of 3000 evacuated, it was Queensland&rsquo;s largest evacuation in history. The Balonne River in St George passed its previous record of 13.48 m, peaking at 13.93 m, but the township remained protected by its 14.5 m levee with damage restricted to the 50 homes. St George also faced pollution problems as floodwaters damaged the local sewerage treatment plant, posing a major public health risk.  At the beginning of March, a category one cyclone off the south-east coast caused further flooding and six evacuation centres were opened across the coast to assist evacuated and displaced people.  The National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) identified the Local Government Areas of Aurukun, Burdekin, Burke, Cairns, Carpentaria, Cassowary Coast, Charters Towers, Cook, Doomadgee, Hinchinbrook, Kowanyama, Mackay, Mapoon, Mornington, Napranum, Northern Peninsula, Palm Island, Pormpuraaw, Tablelands, Townsville City, Torres Strait Islands and Yarrabah as natural disaster zones.

A severe weather warning for flash flooding was issued for most of the state, including the South West, North Central, Northern Country, Wimmera, Mallee, Central, West and South Gippsland and North-East forecast districts.  The State Emergency Service (SES) responded to 650 calls for help across the state on the last days of February following heavy rain and thunderstorms. There was flash flooding and minor building damage across the state after rainfalls of between 50 and 100 mm. In towns such as Seymour there was 120 mm of rain causing flash flooding and road closures. Shops in the main street of Chiltern were flooded after 94 mm of rain fell. The Goulburn Valley Highway was closed north of Seymour due to rainfall. Broken Weir near Benalla recorded the highest rainfall with 167 mm. Castlemaine received 50 mm of rain in a 90 minute period. Police said 11 homes and six shops were flooded.  State Emergency Service (SES) crews were also kept busy dealing with flash flooding at Yarrawonga, Cobram and Shepparton. In addition they had over 350 calls for help in Melbourne, with the hardest hit areas including Brimbank, Doncaster, Emerald and Malvern. There were 89 calls for help in the Ballarat area when storms dumped almost 60 mm of rain. The Daylesford Hospital had some minor flooding, and streets and at least one building were flooded in the area.  On 1 March 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a Severe Weather Warning for heavy rain for residents in the Northern Country, East Gippsland and North East forecast districts.  Broken Creek&nbsp;broke its banks&nbsp;and flooded the town of&nbsp;Numurkah, north of Shepparton.&nbsp;Numurkah Base Hospital and the adjoining Karinya Nursing Home both experienced flooding, with&nbsp;patients and residents evacuated.&nbsp;Flood waters peaked on 5 March and slowly receded with a State Emergency Service spokeswoman saying it would take at least a week for the water to recede completely. Approximately 40 homes and businesses were damaged. The hospital was later delared unsalvagable and limited services resumed from a temporary tent facility, followed by longstanding portables.  Locals and the SES in Nathalia constructed a temporary metal levee with thousands of sandbags, 750 m in length along the banks of Broken Creek, in an attempt to protect the town. Nathalia's temporary levee was purchased after floods hit the town in 1993; it has not been used until this event and it supplements a permanent levee around much of the Nathalia stretch of Broken Creek. Notwithstanding the levee the SES still issued an evacuation order for the town of Nathalia as some doubt existed as to the levees ability to contain the flood waters.

The main road through the region, the Princes Highway, was closed between Rosedale and Traralgon and also east of Orbost due to flood.&nbsp;Wind gusts of up to 150 km per hour brought down trees and blocked parts of the South Gippsland and Monaro highways.  Major flood warnings were issued for the Avon, Macalister, Mitchell, Thomson, Tanjil and Buchan Rivers and the Traralgon Creek. The Yallourn coal mine flooded when the Morwell River burst its banks on early June impacting on coal conveyers and therefore the operation of electricity generators. The operator TRUenergy announced it should be able to restore three of the plant's four generators by the end of June.  The State Emergency Service received 1200 requests for assistance across the state including 450 calls for trees that had fallen and blocked traffic.  Early estimates of flood damage are being assessed, but damage to council infrastructure alone is expected to exceed $10 million. The Department of Human Services paid out Government grants totaling $125,000 to flood-affected residents.  The Victorian Governments Deputy Premier Peter Ryan announced emergency flood assistance grants. Adults are entitled to $480 and children $240, up to a total of $1200.  A media release by the then Federal Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon on 28 June 2012 stated that Victorians affected by flooding in South-Eastern Metropolitan Melbourne and West Gippsland on 22-24 June 2012&nbsp;would be able to get financial assistance in the five local government areas of Baw Baw, Bass Coast, Cardinia, Latrobe and South Gippsland.

Southern areas of Victoria and South Australia and north-eastern area of Tasmania starting experiencing periods of rainfall deficiency in 1996. Conditions improved temporarily in these states by around 1999-2000 when the south-west of Western Australia and southern Queensland commenced experiencing rainfall deficiencies.  By August 2002 severe rainfall deficiencies developed across much of eastern Australia following poor autumn and early winter rains. Parts of south-west Western Australia were deficient in growing season rainfall for the third successive year. All states were affected. January 2003 was one of the driest months on record. Most of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and parts of Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia were affected. In February, Queensland and New South Wales received some relieving rainfall; however June rains were still well below average.  In January 2004 the Bureau of Meteorology announced 18 month rainfall deficiencies in part of eastern and northern Australia. This made it to 23 months by June. In general the south-east areas of Australia received below average rainfall for most of the last eight year period. Good rains in November removed or decreased rainfall deficiencies over many areas, with some deficiencies persisting in southern parts of Western Australia and central Queensland.  The year 2005 saw rainfall deficiencies in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Victoria and South Australia had the driest autumn on record. Good rains in October and November improved conditions in Queensland. In the years 2006-2007, Australia experienced an El Nino event. June 2006 saw poor to record low autumn rains for the sixth year in south-eastern Australia. A distinct turn for the worse occurred in August when near total failure of late winter and spring rains occurred. In June 2007 some easing of severe drought conditions had occurred from autumn rains in New South Wales, north-west Victoria, Tasmania, southern parts of South Australia. Some areas of east Queensland, southern Victoria (near Melbourne) and west Western Australia missed out. May 2008 was the driest May on record and rainfall deficiencies were evident for a 12 month period in eastern South Australia, southern Northern Territory and parts of Victoria and Western Australia.  November 2008 rainfall was above to very much above average over much of Australia. The rain largely cleared short-term rainfall deficiencies, especially in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia; however, average to below average falls in western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia maintained deficiencies in these areas.  The autumn of 2010 was the first autumn with above average rainfall since 2000 in Victoria and the Murray Darling Basin. Serious to severe rainfall deficiency continued in the western area of Western Australia, some shortfall in southern Tasmania and north-eastern New South Wales. Due to excessively dry soils significant rain was required to alleviate the shortage of water across the country resulting from prolonged drought conditions.  December 2010 saw Australia record the wettest spring for the months of September to November with an average of 163 mm of rain beating the previous record by 23 mm. The widespread above average rainfall again missed the south-west corner of Western Australia which experienced a record dry year. Northern and eastern parts of the country continued to receive above to very much above average rainfall, with Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory all recording their wettest spring on record. All states recorded above average rainfall for spring, with all states except Tasmania recording totals placing them in their ten wettest springs on record.  Despite the above average rainfall by mid-2010 water storages had still not returned to pre-drought levels. Irrigated industries such as the Murray-Darling Basin were particularly affected where water storage levels fell to 17 per cent of capacity in 2003 and remained below pre-drought levels until late 2011.  By mid-2010 the Australian Government had paid approximately $4.4 billion in direct drought assistance to affected farmers.

The lodge at the Siding Spring Observatory in the National Park was damaged along with other buildings. However, Australia's largest telescope the Anglo-Australian survived.  The other major areas affected by fire were Yass, Cooma and the Shoalhaven. One house was destroyed in Jugiong and a volunteer firefighter sustained burn injuries in Gundaroo and was airlifted to Sydney for hospital treatment.  A recovery centre was opened in Coonabarabran after the fire. A recovery coordinator was appointed on 21 January by Barry O&rsquo;Farrell concentrating on supporting the Warrumbungles fire affected community.  Approximately 131,000 hectares were burnt in total across the state and extensive farm infrastructure and fences damaged. Approximately 12,000 sheep were lost at an estimated cost of over $1,000,000. Wildlife losses were also significant. The Department teamed with farmers to establish a fodder and fencing donation register to assist farmers rebuilding after the fires.

It made landfall at night between Kowanyama,and Pormpuraaw on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, as a weak category one system with winds up to 100 km per hour. The following morning, as the cyclone moved inland it was downgraded to a tropical low system. The low moved toward the east coast, near Cooktown on 23 January and then tracked slowly to the south-south-east just inland from the coast, impacting areas near Townsville on 24 January. The weather system stalled over the St. Lawrence-Rockhampton area on the 25th and 26th, and then tracked south to near Dalby west of Brisbane on the 28th, finally accelerating in a southerly direction eventually moving offshore south of Sydney on 29 January.  The ex-tropical cyclone brought with it a heavy monsoonal rainfall system that lasted for approximately one week. Most of the eastern areas of Queensland, and the coast of New South Wales ending in the Wollongong area experienced very heavy rainfall during the period from 22 to 29 January 2013. On 25 January, areas around Rockhampton recorded rainfall for a 24 hour period in excess of 300 mm. Rainfall for the areas between Rockhampton and Bundaberg alone were heavy enough to break the January monthly rainfall records. On 28 January, the most extreme daily rainfall for the week occurred over the Gold Coast Hinterland and New South Wales border catchment and the edge of the Brisbane river catchment where rainfall for a 24 hour period was in excess of 700 mm both hitting record levels. The Queensland State Emergency Service received 1800 calls for help in 24 hours on the 28 January, mostly in the south-east areas of the state.  Six people were killed due to the extreme weather over the course of the week. Thousands were forced to evacuate, 2000 people were isolated by floodwaters for some days requiring emergency supply drops. Approximately 40 water rescues took place by State Emergency Service volunteers.  Key infrastructure was damaged and destroyed, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The rail service was closed between Cairns and Townsville, the Weipa port shut down for several days, airlines cancelled many domestic flights between New South Wales and Queensland, travellers were stranded as they tried to return home after the long weekend, 200 schools were closed on the first day of school for the year and the worst ever power outages occurred in Queensland affecting 283,000 properties.  On 27 January, the system moved south impacting Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast with damaging to destructive winds, torrential rain, dangerous surf and tidal inundation for a 24 hour period. Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron.&nbsp;Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam.  Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where approximately 2000 evacuations occurred. The New South Wales State Emergency Service attended to&nbsp;more than&nbsp;2900 calls for assistance Eight New South Wales river systems had flood warnings in place. Coastal erosion of beaches was evidenced in these regions along with sea foam covering some roads and parks on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Overall, Bundaberg was the worst affected city with 2000 homes and 200 businesses inundated with flood water. The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatening houses. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane.  On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe. Defence personnel, 180 in total, went house to house within an exclusion zone, conducting search and rescue operations. Defence personnel also helped to repair damaged infrastructure and clean people's homes as part of the initial recovery operation.  Financial assistance and grants were made available to eligible Queensland flood victims, including:    Queensland Floods Appeal 2013 payments  Emergent Assistance Grant  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)  Essential Services Safety and Reconnection Grant.    The Queensland government also provided financial help and support services to business owners and primary producers such as low interest loans and clean up and recovery grants. Other assistance included freight subsidies, Individual Disaster Stricken Property (IDSP) declarations and leasehold rent relief.  The Federal Attorney-General announced flood and storm victims, employees, small business persons and farmers could apply for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments:    New South Wales - January 2013: $17,254,788 scheduled to be paid.  Queensland - January 2013:&nbsp; $141,449,554 scheduled to be paid.

The fire burned various hazardous chemicals including acrylonitrile, phenol, methyl ethyl ketone and benzene forming clouds of potentially toxic black smoke up to 30 km from the site, prompting the evacuation of Footscray Primary School, nearby buildings and ships, and closure of roads. People were advised to stay inside with windows and doors closed to avoid smoke inhalation. Testing conducted later showed that the smoke was not a chemical hazard due largely to the heat of the fire and high winds helped to dissipate the smoke from the area.  It took 155 fire fighters approximately three hours to gain control of the fire and two were injured in the process. The following morning at approximately 11.45 am, a ruptured pipeline caused an explosion in another storage tank that sent a fireball into the sky. This fire spread to four other storage tanks and burned until control was gained at around 4 pm. Fire fighting efforts alone were estimated to cost $2 million as the fire control required large quantities of foam.  In total, approximately 16 chemical storage tanks were damaged or destroyed, with approximately 8.6 million litres of chemicals burnt and more leaking.  A Coronial Inquest was held 26 April 1994 to 20 May 1994, where 59 witnesses presented evidence. The findings of the Coronial Inquest were released 17 June 1994. The Coroner found on the balance of probabilities that a corona discharge occurred, igniting the chemicals within Tank 80. A corona discharge, colloquially known as St Elmo's fire, is akin to lightning, but in slow motion and with a much lower discharge of energy. The Coroner praised fire fighters and other emergency service personnel for their efforts in the response.  Damage and clean-up costs were later assessed at between $20 and $35 million. The owner of the facility was charged under environment protection and labour laws with the penalty imposed in the vicinity of $1.3 million. According to the Financial Review the owners held an insurance cover of $20 million which covered the replacement value of the facility in addition to public liability insurance. Therefore, the insurance cost of Coode Island is assessed as $21.3 million.", "Motor Vehicle(s) destroyed": null, "Building(s) destroyed": null, "Com Premises destroyed": null, "Building(s) damaged": null, "lat": "-37.81663132", "Business(es) destroyed": null, "Motor Vehicle(s) damaged": null, "Deaths": null, "resourceType": "Disaster Event", "Ind Premises destroyed": null, "author": "", "Bridge(s) damaged": null, "url": "http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=3495", "Homeless": null, "_id": 645, "Injuries": null, "Water vessel(s) damaged": null}, {"startDate": "2013-03-24T10:45:00", "Livestock destroyed": null, "endDate": "2013-03-29T10:45:00", "Crop(s) destroyed": "", "Insured Cost": null, "documentType": "", "Business(es) damaged": null, "Bridge(s) destroyed": null, "Farm(s) destroyed": null, "Aircraft destroyed": null, "Farm(s) damaged": null, "Home(s) destroyed": null, "Train(s) destroyed": null, "Water vessel(s) destroyed": null, "id": "3532", "Evacuated": null, "Aircraft damaged": null, "resourceUrl": "", "title": "Epidemic - Gastroenteritis Outbreak From Oysters", "lon": "147.8031921", "Train(s) damaged": null, "regions": "Tasmania", "subjects": "", "Com Premises damaged": null, "Government assistance": null, "Home(s) damaged": null, "description": "From 24 March to 29 March oysters harvested and sold out of lease 113 near Dunalley&nbsp;south of Hobart contained a norovirus that caused an outbreak of gastroenteritis.

The tornado lasted only five minutes, but in this time the wind caused considerable destruction. Roofs were lifted off houses, caravans were overturned and some commercial buildings were severely damaged including the Cobram Barooga Golf Club, several historic buildings in the main street of Rutherglen, two caravan parks, a car dealership and a winery.  Approximately 24 people were injured, many from flying debris during the tornado. Four people were airlifted to Melbourne by Ambulance Victoria with serious injuries while others were treated locally in hospitals such as Yarrawonga where the local motels were utilised to ensure enough beds for patients.  The State Emergency Service received approximately 150 calls for assistance during this period, most requiring help with fallen trees blocking roads or damaging houses. The Hume Freeway, near Benalla, and the Murray Valley Highway at Bundalong were forced to close for a period of time until fallen trees were cleared. Disruptions occurred to local power and telecommunications services.  Approximately fifteen homes were deemed uninhabitable in Koonoomoo, seven in Bundalong and two in Rutherglen. Fourteen properties were badly damaged in Bundalong and 19 other properties sustained damaged across the region. It is estimated over 100 caravans were damaged by the wind.  Orchards and vineyards across Mulwala, Yarrawonga, Bundalong, Koonoomoo and Rutherglen were also impacted by the tornado. One peach grower in Koonoomoo had 2000 fruit trees flattened by the winds, causing damage in excess of $100,000.  The federal and state governments agreed to provide emergency financial assistance for those affected by the tornadoes. Recovery efforts were hindered by scattered debris, for example, in some locations there are sheets of iron high up trees and asbestos has been uncovered in the damage.

The most serious fires started in the Blue Mountains on 16 and 17 October.  The fires began on 13 October when strong winds and high temperatures caused a fire near Port Stephens and destroyed six houses. Several sheds and cars were also burnt in the fires and dozens of residents spent the night in evacuation centres. One person died at Lake Munmorah while protecting their home. Fires also occurred around the Hunter and Hawksbury regions. At the same time, more than 100 firefighters were fighting bushfires at Tangory Mountain, Webbs Creek, Wollemi National Park, the Southern Highlands and the Central Coast.  On 16 October, a defence training exercise at Marrangaroo near the Blue Mountains, accidently sparked a fire that became known as the &lsquo;State Mine Fire&rsquo;. It had a perimeter of 190km and eventually burnt nearly 46,000 hectares between Lithgow and Mt Tomah. At its most severe, the fire travelled 25 km per hour through bushland.  Thousands of people in Lithgow were evacuated and the communities of Bell, Bilpin, Berambing, Clarence, Dargan, Hartley Vale, Mount Wilson were also affected. The fire devastated the recently restored tourist attraction, Zig Zag Railway, with equipment and train carriages destroyed.  On 17 October two more major fires began in the lower Blue Mountains: one near Mt Victoria and the other at Springwood. Wimallee and Yellowrock were the worst affected communities with 193 homes destroyed and 100 damaged. Staff and patients at the Springwood Hospital were evacuated as a precaution. With the three fires burning uncontrollably in the Blue Mountains, on 18 October, Victoria sent fire crews and equipment to assist with the NSW firefighting efforts. A State of Emergency was announced for NSW on 20 October.  By 22 October the State Mine Fire had travelled south and was threatening to join up with the Mt Victoria Fire. The Rural Fire Service decided to deliberately allow the State Mine Fire to join the Mount Victoria Fire in a controlled way by managing fuel loads and back-burning to create firebreaks. While this was a high risk strategy, by 25 October cooler weather conditions allowed firefighters to bring the three Blue Mountains Fires under control. The fires were declared extinguished on 13 November. A total of approximately 118,000 hectares was burnt across the state.

It was one of 68 fires burning across Victoria during this time.  The fire coincided with a heatwave across Victoria with temperatures reaching over 40 C in the Grampians region from 15 - 20 January. The fire eventually burnt 52,000 hectares including bushland and farms and was declared contained on 21 January 2014. Many residents from Dadswell&rsquo;s Gap, Wartook, Brimpean, St Helen&rsquo;s Plain, Roses Gap Pomonal, Bellfield, Lake Fyans, Lake Lonsdale, Heatherlie and Ledcourt were affected by the fires. Halls Gap was threatened by the fire front and ember attack and most of the town evacuated. Relief centres were set up in Horsham, Stawell and Ararat for the hundreds of people who were evacuated from their homes. Farmers lost large numbers of sheep that were either killed by the fire or later culled. At least 7000 sheep in total were lost.  A 12 km wide pyro cumulus cloud column of smoke and fire was created by the fire, generating its own weather pattern including lightning and thunder. This cloud gathered burning embers into the sky, which then scattered for many kilometres beyond the fire front, potentially starting new fires.  Once the fire was contained, emergency services began assisting people to return to their homes and cleaning up the tourist attractions in time for visitors to be able to come to the Grampians National Park over the Australia Day long weekend.  Financial assistance for people in bushfire affected communities was provided under the jointly funded Commonwealth-Victorian Natural Disaster Relief Recovery Arrangements. This included making available concessional loans for small businesses and primary producers. Local councils were also provided with funds for clean-up activities and to repair essential public assets.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;", "Motor Vehicle(s) destroyed": null, "Building(s) destroyed": "30", "Com Premises destroyed": null, "Building(s) damaged": null, "lat": "-37.12911987", "Business(es) destroyed": null, "Motor Vehicle(s) damaged": null, "Deaths": null, "resourceType": "Disaster Event", "Ind Premises destroyed": null, "author": "", "Bridge(s) damaged": null, "url": "http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=4946", "Homeless": null, "_id": 668, "Injuries": null, "Water vessel(s) damaged": null}, {"startDate": "2014-01-11T00:00:00", "Livestock destroyed": "80", "endDate": "2014-01-21T00:00:00", "Crop(s) destroyed": "", "Insured Cost": null, "documentType": "", "Business(es) damaged": null, "Bridge(s) destroyed": null, "Farm(s) destroyed": null, "Aircraft destroyed": null, "Farm(s) damaged": null, "Home(s) destroyed": null, "Train(s) destroyed": null, "Water vessel(s) destroyed": null, "id": "4960", "Evacuated": null, "Aircraft damaged": null, "resourceUrl": "", "title": "Environmental - Heatwave, South-Eastern Australia, 2014", "lon": "140.9765625", "Train(s) damaged": null, "regions": "Queensland;New South Wales;Victoria;South Australia;Western Australia;Tasmania", "subjects": "", "Com Premises damaged": null, "Government assistance": null, "Home(s) damaged": null, "description": "In the second week of January 2014, the extreme heat in Western Australia that saw record breaking temperatures of up to 48 &deg;C, moved eastwards into South Australia and Victoria.  It was the first heatwave to be classified under the Bureau of Meteorology&rsquo;s new modelling system of Heatwave, Severe Heatwave and Extreme Heatwave.  During the next two weeks, both states experienced the numerous effects of extreme heat. In South Australia, 13-17 January recorded the first ever five-day period above 42 &deg;C, the hottest maximum five-day average temperature of 43.6 &deg;C and on 16 January, Adelaide was the hottest city in the world, at 46 &deg;C. In the same period, Victoria recorded its first ever four-day period above 41&deg;C and its hottest four-day average maximum temperature at 43.1 &deg;C.  The Bureau of Meteorology released a Special Climate Statement for the period from 13 to 18 January and stated that the heatwave was more notable for persistent heat than individual extreme hot days.  Heat-related power outages affected approximately 35,000 people in Victoria during the evening of 14 January, while about 5000 South Australian residents&nbsp;were temporarily without electricity.  The heatwave resulted in 275 people being admitted to South Australian hospitals for heat-related conditions. In Victoria, 505 people were treated by Ambulance Victoria for heat exhaustion, and 208 people were treated for cardiac arrest, at one time cardiac arrest calls being received every six minutes. More than 1000 spectators&nbsp;required treatment for heat exhaustion at the Australian Open, which was held from 13 to 26 January. The Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine recorded 139 deaths in excess of the average expected between 13 and 23 January.  On 21 January, 80 cows died due to heat stress in Victoria&rsquo;s Gippsland region. More than 90 flying foxes were found dead in Adelaide&rsquo;s Botanic Park, following the death of 100,000 bats in a Queensland heatwave during the first week of January.  Other states affected by the 13 to 18 January heatwave were the western half of Tasmania and around and to the west of the New South Wales Snowy Mountain region.

Over the weekend of 8 and 9 February, the Country Fire Authority (CFA) was at its highest state of readiness with interstate and New Zealand colleagues on standby.  While existing fires continued to burn in East Gippsland, new fires broke out on 9 February in the Latrobe Valley and north of Melbourne at Mickleham, Gisborne, Riddells Creek&nbsp;and Warrandyte. Six thousand firefighters were mobilised across the state and thousands of people evacuated.  High winds and very dry conditions resulted in three homes&nbsp;destroyed in Warrandyte, one in Gisborne and one in Morwell before these fires were brought under control. However, a fire in the Hazelwood Mine at Morwell continued to burn (see the Hazelwood Mine entry for further information on this disaster).  The Mickleham Road Complex was a fast moving grassfire that remained out of control for a number of days. It split into two fire-fronts threatening both Kilmore and Wallan. The fire also impacted the communities of Beveridge, Darraweit Guim, Springwood, Chintin, Forbes and Bylands, Wallan, Willowmavin and Craigieburn. Once the Mickleham fire was contained, the threat of smouldering trees falling continued amongst the fire affected areas. A total of 13 homes were&nbsp;destroyed as well as other farm infrastructure and approximately 10,000 sheep and 600 cattle also perished.  While the East Gippsland fires continued to burn in remote bushland, by 14 February the fire no longer posed a threat to private property. More than 130,000 hectares were burnt and 15 homes destroyed. Approximately 100 farm properties were also affected with stock and fencing losses.  The Victorian Government announced people affected by the fires would have immediate access to grants of up to $30,000 if their homes were destroyed or significantly damaged due to the fire. The Commonwealth and Victorian Governments National Disaster Recovery Payments were also made available to those affected by the fires.", "Motor Vehicle(s) destroyed": null, "Building(s) destroyed": null, "Com Premises destroyed": null, "Building(s) damaged": null, "lat": "-37.56471634", "Business(es) destroyed": null, "Motor Vehicle(s) damaged": null, "Deaths": null, "resourceType": "Disaster Event", "Ind Premises destroyed": null, "author": "Karyn Stamp", "Bridge(s) damaged": null, "url": "http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=5015", "Homeless": null, "_id": 671, "Injuries": "3", "Water vessel(s) damaged": null}, {"startDate": "2014-02-09T00:00:00", "Livestock destroyed": null, "endDate": "2014-03-19T00:00:00", "Crop(s) destroyed": "", "Insured Cost": null, "documentType": "", "Business(es) damaged": null, "Bridge(s) destroyed": null, "Farm(s) destroyed": null, "Aircraft destroyed": null, "Farm(s) damaged": null, "Home(s) destroyed": null, "Train(s) destroyed": null, "Water vessel(s) destroyed": null, "id": "5041", "Evacuated": "0", "Aircraft damaged": null, "resourceUrl": "", "title": "Complex Emergencies - Hazelwood open cut mine fire, Morwell, Victoria 2014", "lon": "146.3935089", "Train(s) damaged": null, "regions": "Victoria", "subjects": "", "Com Premises damaged": null, "Government assistance": null, "Home(s) damaged": null, "description": "The Hazelwood open cut mine fire began on 9 February 2014, during the worst fire conditions in Victoria since Black Saturday. It was started by a nearby grassfire and was one of 70 blazes across the state during this time. The fire continued burning for four weeks, with the Victorian Country Fire Authority (CFA) declaring it under control on 19 February 2014 and safe on 25 March 2014. It was a complex disaster for three reasons; firstly, the size of the fire and magnitude of the firefighting efforts, secondly, the public health emergency for the responders and people of Morwell and thirdly, the financial cost of the disaster.  Morwell is located close to the Hazelwood mine, with some people living 400 metres from the mine site. The fire released large amounts of smoke and ash that settled on the communities of Morwell. Twenty firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation and hundreds of people in Morwell complained of breathing problems over the duration of the fire. People also reported poor visibility and an unpleasant odour, meaning that they couldn&rsquo;t spend extended time outdoors  The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) was responsible for monitoring air quality and reporting to government. Acknowledging the poor air quality and discomfort faced by the people of Morwell, the Victorian Government suggested people have short breaks from Morwell, made health checks available and distributed face masks. On 28 February, the Victorian Chief Health Officer, Rosemary Lester advised that the elderly, sick, children and pregnant women should temporarily leave South Morwell. The Federal and Victorian governments provided grants of up to $1250 to assist with their temporary relocation.  Many schools and childcare centres in Morwell closed and relocated students during the fire. A County Court Judge was forced to postpone a trial held in Morwell due to the smoke and poor air conditions. &nbsp;  Hazelwood was the most serious mine fire in Australian history, with advice and support obtained from local and international experts in the field. Mine fires are very difficult to control, particularly if the coal seam begins to burn as was the case at Hazelwood. More than 7000 firefighters from the CFA, interstate agencies and the mine owners were deployed over the 45 days. They used water and foam to cool the fire down and then dug out the burning coal, spraying it with water. This is a very time consuming process. More than 500 firefighters battled the fire at any one time, with 86,000 litres of water used per minute.  A number of homes have been badly damaged by ash and fire, including their interiors.  The Victorian Government announced on 11 March 2014, that former Supreme Court Justice Bernard Teague will head an inquiry into the mine fire.  The Victorian Government also announced on 18 March 2014, a two million dollar package to assist with the clean up following the Hazelwood fire.
